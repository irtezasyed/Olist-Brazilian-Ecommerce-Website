# Olist-Brazilian-Ecommerce-Website
Description:
Olist is an Ecommerce Platform that allows sellers and businesses to sell their products on the Olist Store website.  They connect small businesses from all over Brazil to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers.

Problem statement:
My aim in this project is to provide meaningful and useful insights into the two databases â€“ Market Funnel and Brazilian E-Commerce which is available at Kaggle.
I will be performing exploratory data analysis and creating visuals using a BI Tool to provide key analytical inisghts recommendations and strategies for the sales and marketing teams at Olist.

Impact: 
Using the results of this analysis Olist can:
    Summarize their performance.
    Make informed marketing decisions.
    Predict future revenue and customer behaviour.
    Optimize customer experience.
